## What is Conway's Game?
Conway's "Game" of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from a player. So, a player interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration (pattern) and then letting it run, observing how it evolves. Advanced ..."players" can create patterns with particular properties and either predict their evolution or just let the game take it where it will.
